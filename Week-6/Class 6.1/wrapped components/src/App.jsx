// In React, wrapper components are used to encapsulate and group common styling or thematic elements that need to 
// be applied consistently across different parts of an application. These components act as containers for specific
// sections or functionalities, allowing for a clean and modular structure.  

// children is simply the content that you pass between the componentâ€™s opening and closing tags.
