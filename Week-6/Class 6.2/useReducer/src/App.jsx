// The useReducer hook is a React hook designed for managing complex state logic within functional components. It 
// provides a more structured approach compared to useState. The useReducer hook involves a reducer function that 
// determines how the state should change based on actions dispatched to it. This function takes the current state 
// and an action as arguments, returning the new state. Along with the reducer, you provide an initialState to 
// initialize the state. The hook returns the current state and a dispatch function, which is used to send actions 
// to the reducer and trigger state updates.
