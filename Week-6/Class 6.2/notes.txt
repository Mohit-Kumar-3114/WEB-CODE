Question- What are hooks in react?
Answer- In React, hooks are functions that allow functional components to have state and lifecycle features that 
were previously only available in class components. Hooks were introduced in React 16.8 to enable developers to use 
state and other React features without writing a class.




Question- What are the advantage of hooks over class based components?
Answer- Hooks in React offer a simpler and more concise way to manage state and lifecycle events in functional 
components compared to class-based components. They eliminate the need for complex class syntax, the use of `this`, 
and provide a more modular and reusable approach to organizing code. Hooks, such as `useState` and `useEffect`, 
enhance code readability, promote better separation of concerns, and make testing easier. They also align well with 
functional programming principles, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.
