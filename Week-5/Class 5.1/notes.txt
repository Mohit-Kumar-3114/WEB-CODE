Question- What is react?
Answer- ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library used to create user interfaces in a declarative and efficient 
way. For dynamic websites, these libraries make it easier to do DOM manipulation. React is just an easier way to 
write normal HTML/CSS/JS. Itâ€™s a new syntax, that under the hood gets converted to HTML/CSS/JS using npm run build.




Question- What is virtual dom?
Answer- In React, the Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the Real DOM that helps make updates faster and more 
efficient. When something in your app changes, React first updates the Virtual DOM instead of directly modifying the 
Real DOM. It then compares the new Virtual DOM with the old version to see what has changed. Once it finds the 
differences, React only updates those specific parts of the Real DOM, instead of reloading the entire page or large 
sections of it. This process significantly improves performance because updating the Real DOM directly is slow and 
can make the app laggy with frequent changes. By using the Virtual DOM, React ensures smoother and quicker updates 
to the user interface.




Question- What is state, components and re-rendering in react?
Answer- State is an object that holds information about the current status of the app, like the value of a counter, 
which can change over time. Components are self-contained, reusable pieces of code that work like JavaScript 
functions but return HTML. The Button component, for example, takes the state (count) as an input and updates how it 
looks based on that state. Re-rendering in React refers to the process of updating the visual representation of a 
component in response to changes in its state or props, ensuring the user interface reflects the latest data.

In React, when the state changes, React automatically re-renders the component to reflect that change. This way, 
your users always see the most up-to-date and accurate information on the screen.




Question- What is jsx?
Answer- JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used with React, allowing developers to write 
HTML-like code in their JavaScript files.




Question- What are props?
Answer- In React, props (short for properties) are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component. 
They allow you to customize and configure child components based on values provided by their parent components. 
Props in React are read-only. A child component cannot modify the props it receives from a parent. Props are 
intended to be immutable.
