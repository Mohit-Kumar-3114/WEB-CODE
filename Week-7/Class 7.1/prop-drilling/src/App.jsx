// Prop drilling refers to the process of passing down data (props) from a parent component to nested child 
// components through multiple layers in the component tree. In React or other component-based frameworks, 
// components are often organized in a hierarchical structure, and sometimes, data needs to be passed from a 
// top-level component to a deeply nested component. Prop drilling involves passing this data through each 
// intermediate component in the hierarchy until it reaches its intended destination.

// Prop drilling can lead to verbose and boilerplate code, especially in large component trees. Passing the same
// props through multiple layers of components can make the code harder to read and maintain.
