Question- What is client side bundling?
Answer- Client-side bundling refers to the process of combining multiple JavaScript, CSS, or other resource files 
into a single file (or a few files) that is sent to the client's browser. By bundling resources together, you reduce 
the number of HTTP requests the browser has to make, which can lead to faster page load and improved user experience.




Question- What is client side routing?
Answer- Client-side routing is a feature of Single Page Applications (SPAs) that allows for dynamic content updates 
without full page reloads. When the URL changes, the client-side router catches it, figures out which page or 
section to show, and updates the content on the same HTML page without reloading it.




Question- What is react-router-dom?
Answer- React Router DOM is a popular library for React that lets you add navigation and routing to your app.
The main components involved in React Router DOM are BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route. 

1. BrowserRouter: The BrowserRouter component is a top-level component that should be used to wrap your entire 
application. It enables the use of routing features throughout your React application. 

2. Routes: The Routes component is act as a container for your Route components.The Routes component can contain
multiple Route components, each representing a different view or page.

3. Route: The Route component is responsible for rendering specific components based on the current URL path. It 
takes two main props: path and element. The path prop defines the URL path that should match for the route to be 
rendered, and the element prop specifies the component to render when the path matches.
