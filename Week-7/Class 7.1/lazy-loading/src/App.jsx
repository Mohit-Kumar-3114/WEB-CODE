// Lazy loading in React is a technique to improve performance by loading components only when they're needed, 
// rather than all at once. Itâ€™s done using `React.lazy()` to dynamically import components and `Suspense` to show a
// fallback UI (like a loader) while waiting for the component to load. This reduces the initial load time, leading 
// to a faster and smoother user experience, especially for large applications.

// When you don't use `React.lazy` (or a similar code-splitting technique), all the code for every component (like 
// `Dashboard`, `Landing`, etc.) is bundled together into a single large JavaScript file. This means that even if 
// you're only viewing the `Dashboard` page, the code for `Landing` (and other components) will also be loaded 
// initially, which can lead to slower loading times. In contrast, using `React.lazy` ensures that each component is
// loaded on demand. For instance, navigating to the `/landing` route will only fetch `landing.jsx` at that time,
// and navigating to `/dashboard` will fetch `dashboard.jsx`, improving performance and reducing the initial load
// time.

// In React, Suspense is a built in component used with lazy loading to show a fallback UI (like a loader or message) 
// while your component is still being loaded.
