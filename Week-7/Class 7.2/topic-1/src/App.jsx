// App is a stateful component that manages a count state. A stateful component is a component that manages its own 
// state using something like useState or useReducer. 

// App2 is a stateless component that receives the count as a prop and displays it. A stateless component does not 
// manage any state â€” it just receives data via props and displays it.
