// In React, state management refers to the management of the component's local state as well as the flow of data 
// between components avoiding unnecessary re-rendering.

// Recoil is a state management library for React applications developed by Facebook. It provides a simple and 
// flexible way to manage the state of your application, especially when dealing with complex state logic and 
// sharing state among different components. Other ones are redux, zustand etc.

// Atoms are units of state in Recoil. They represent individual pieces of state that can be read from or written
// to by different components.

// Selectors provide a cleaner and more maintainable approach to compute derived values from state in state 
// management libraries like Recoil. They encapsulate logic, promote reusability, and come with built-in 
// optimizations for improved performance by recalculating values only when necessary. It is like useMemo not same.

// The RecoilRoot is a component provided by Recoil that serves as the root of the Recoil state tree. It must be
// placed at the top level of your React component tree to enable the use of Recoil atoms and selectors throughout
// your application.

// useRecoilState is a hook that returns an array where the first element is the current state value, and the 
// second element is a function to update the state. 

// useRecoilValue is a hook that returns the current value of the Recoil state.

// useSetRecoilState is a hook that returns a function that allows you to update the value of the Recoil state.

// Using `setCount(count => count + 1)` ensures that you always work with the most recent state, especially during
// asynchronous or batched updates. If you use `setCount(count + 1)`, multiple updates could refer to the same
// initial state, leading to incorrect results. The function version guarantees that each update accurately
// reflects the latest state.
