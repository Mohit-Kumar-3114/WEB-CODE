Question- What are error boundaries in react?
Answer- In React, Error Boundaries are special components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child 
component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of breaking the entire app. They act like a 
“try...catch” for React components.
       Without error boundaries, if a component throws an error during rendering, React will unmount the whole 
component tree — meaning your UI can completely disappear. Error boundaries let you gracefully handle these crashes 
and show a friendly message instead.




Question- Explain stric mode in react?
Answer- Strict Mode in React is a development-only feature that helps you identify potential problems in your code 
early before they cause bugs in production. Runs only in development — it has no effect in production builds.




Question- Why effects run twice in Strict Mode?
Answer- In React Strict Mode, effects run twice in development to help find bugs. React mounts your component, runs 
the effect, removes it, then runs it again to check if your cleanup code works properly.
