Question- What are middlewares?
Answer- In simple words, middleware in JavaScript, particularly in the context of web development with frameworks 
like Express.js, is a function that runs between the request from the client and the response from the server. 
Middleware functions can perform various tasks, such as logging requests, handling authentication, modifying request 
or response objects, and more, before passing control to the next middleware function or the final request handler.




Question- What are global catches?
Answer- This is a middleware that catches errors not caught by other specific error-handling middleware. It's 
typically defined as the last middleware in the chain and uses app.use with a function that has four parameters and 
an error as its first parameter. Global catches or error handlers are like safety nets for your app. They're there 
to catch any problems that sneak by and stop your app from crashing. They help by keeping your app running smoothly 
even when unexpected errors show up. These catches make sure errors are handled in a way that won't disrupt your 
users.




Question- What is input validation?
Answer- Input validation is a way of checking and ensuring that the data entered or provided by user meets certain 
criteria or standards before it's processed or accepted by a system. It's an essential security and reliability 
measure used in software development to prevent potentially harmful or incorrect data from causing issues within an 
application.




Question- What is zod?
Answer- "Zod" refers to a library called "Zod" that is used for runtime checking and validation of data structures. 
It helps ensure that the data your application receives or processes adheres to a specific schema or structure, 
thereby enhancing type safety and reducing runtime errors.
