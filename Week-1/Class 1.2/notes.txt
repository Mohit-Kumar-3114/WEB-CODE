executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

function is called as a callback function.




Question- What is setTimeout function?
Answer- setTimeout() takes a callback function as an argument and executes the callback function after a specified 
amount of time. It takes two arguments: the first is the callback function to be executed, and the second is the 
time delay in milliseconds before the callback is invoked.




Question- What is setInterval function?
Answer- The setInterval() method calls a function at specified intervals (in milliseconds). The setInterval() 
method continues calling the function until clearInterval() is called, or the window is closed. It takes two 
arguments: the first is the callback function to be executed, and the second is the time delay in milliseconds 
after the callback is called again.
