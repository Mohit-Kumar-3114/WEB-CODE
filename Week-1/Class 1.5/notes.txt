Question- What is difference between synchronous and asynchronous functions?
Answer- A synchronous function executes line by line, one after another. Each step waits for the previous one to 
finish before moving on. An asynchronous function allows tasks to run in the background, so the program doesnâ€™t wait 
for them to finish. Other code can execute in the meantime.




Question- What is fs.readFile function?
Answer- The fs.readFile() method is an inbuilt method which is used to read the file. To load the fs module we use 
require() method. For example: const fs = require("fs"). Syntax-fs.readFile(filename, encoding, callback_function).
By default encoding is buffer format which is machine readable but we use human readable encoding ie utf-8. If 
function is not globally found then write npm i fs in integrated terminal.




Question- Who handle js asynchronous code?
Answer- JS asynchronous code is handled by a c++ library known as libuv which works on node. It gives I/O support
to js but it does not works on heavy tasks like cpu intensive.




Question- Describe js browser architecture?
Answer- When synchronous code runs, functions are executed in sequence and added to the call stack, blocking the 
main thread until they complete. However, asynchronous operations, encountered as functions like setTimeout, 
fetch follow a different path. Instead of executing immediately, they are delegated to the Web/Node APIs and 
removed from the call stack, allowing the synchronous code to continue without waiting for their completion. 
These APIs handle these operations externally, and once they finish, their associated callbacks are placed in 
the callback queue. The event loop continuously monitors the call stack and the callback queue. When the call 
stack is empty, the event loop moves callbacks from the queue to the stack for execution, ensuring that 
asynchronous results are processed without blocking the main thread. This mechanism enables JavaScript to manage 
both synchronous and asynchronous tasks efficiently, maintaining responsiveness in applications while handling 
time-consuming operations seamlessly.  




Question- What are web APIs?
Answer- These are environments where JavaScript asynchronous code runs, providing functionalities beyond the 
language itself.
