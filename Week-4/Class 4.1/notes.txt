Question- What is dom?
Answer- The DOM stands for Document Object Model — it’s a programming interface that represents a web page’s 
structure as a tree of objects so that code (JavaScript, for example) can interact with it. When your browser loads 
a webpage, it takes the HTML and turns it into a tree-like structure where each element (<div>, <p>, <img>, etc.) 
is a node. This structure is the DOM, and it lets you read, modify, add, or remove elements dynamically.
