Question- What are custom hooks?
Answer- Hooks that you create yourself, so other people can use them are called custom hooks. A custom hook is 
effectively a function, but with the following properties - 
1. Uses another hook internally (useState, useEffect, another custom hook)
2. Starts with use
 
A few good examples of this can be -
1. Data fetching hooks
2. Browser functionality related hooks - useOnlineStatus , useWindowSize, useMousePosition
3. Performance/Timer based - useInterval, useDebounce
